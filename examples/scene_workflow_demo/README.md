# Scene Workflow Demo

This example demonstrates how to use **Scene Nodes** in the Story Graph to organize a visual novel using the **Code-First workflow**.

## Story Structure

```
[Scene: intro] ─┬─→ [Scene: cafe_meeting] ─┬─→ [Scene: project_discussion] ─┬─→ [Scene: good_ending]
                │                           │                                 │
                │                           │                                 └─→ [Scene: neutral_ending]
                │                           │
                │                           └─→ [Scene: early_ending]
```

## Scenes Overview

| Scene | Description | Outcomes |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| `intro` | Morning street, meet Alice | → cafe_meeting |
| `cafe_meeting` | Cafe interior, meet Bob | → project_discussion, early_ending |
| `project_discussion` | Bob's project proposal | → good_ending, neutral_ending |
| `good_ending` | Partnership formed | END |
| `neutral_ending` | Maybe next time | END |
| `early_ending` | Left before proposal | END |

## Key Features Demonstrated

1. **Scene-based organization**: Each major story beat is a Scene Node
2. **Menu branching**: Player choices affect story flow
3. **Variable tracking**: `trust_level` affects available options
4. **Conditional logic**: Different paths based on player behavior
5. **Graph block markers**: `@graph-begin`/`@graph-end` for visual graph integration

## How to Use

1. Open this project in NovelMind Editor
2. View the **Story Graph** to see scene connections
3. Double-click any Scene Node to open **Scene View**
4. Right-click any Scene Node → "Open Script" to edit the `.nms` file
5. Use **Play-in-Editor** to test the story flow

## Files

- `scripts/main.nms` - Main script with all scene definitions
- `scenes/` - Scene layout files (generated by Scene View)

## Workflow Tips

- Scene Nodes in Story Graph provide high-level narrative overview
- Each scene's `.nms` script contains the detailed dialogue and logic
- Use `goto <scene_name>` to transition between scenes
- The `@graph-begin`/`@graph-end` markers are auto-generated when you edit connections in Story Graph
